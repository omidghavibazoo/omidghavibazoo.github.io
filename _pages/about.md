I am a recent PhD graduate in Finance from the [University of St. Gallen (HSG)](https://www.unisg.ch/en/), Switzerland. Before joining the University of St. Gallen in 2017, I was an Actuary at Mellat Insurance, Iran.

My research interests lies in the fields of finance, actuarial science, risk management and behavioral economics. I have been involved in multiple research projects that required actuarial and financial modeling using statistical techniques and data analysis.
