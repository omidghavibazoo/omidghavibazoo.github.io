* M Eling, O Ghavibazoo and K Hanewald (2021), [Willingness to take financial risks and insurance holdings: A European survey](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socec.2021.101781), <em>Journal of Behavioral and Experimental Economics</em>, 95, 1-15.
  * We provide a structured literature review of long-term care (LTC) insurance using main path analysis, a mathematical tool to identify the most significant paths in a citation network. We identify three major research areas (financing, demand, and insurability) and systematically evaluate them based on standard frameworks. We further review established and innovative (insurance) solutions for LTC financing. Our results illustrate the immense difficulties of insuring LTC both on the demand side (e.g., low value of consumption while in care, existence of substitutes) and supply side (e.g., lack of predictability and asymmetric information), explaining the marginal contribution of insurance mechanisms to LTC financing. Combined products that bundle the risks, and publicâ€“private partnerships that integrate LTC into the pension systems might help to overcome the insurability limitations. In addition, alternative financing methods that go beyond the idea of risk pooling (LTC bond, LTC put option, equity release) could help to improve the sustainability of LTC financing.

  * We investigate the relationship between self-reported willingness to take financial risks and ownership of life insurance and long-term care insurance. For a representative sample of individuals aged 50+ from 14 countries and controlling for demographic and socioeconomic determinants of insurance demand, we find a positive link between willingness to take financial risks and ownership of both long-term care insurance and life insurance. The link is stronger for whole life insurance compared to term life insurance and long-term care insurance. Two robustness tests that (i) use risky asset ownership instead of willingness to take financial risks and (ii) focus on specific demographic and socioeconomic groups confirm the results for life insurance, while the results for long-term care insurance are less clear. Our empirical results cannot be explained by the classical expected utility framework and thus support recent research indicating that alternative models (e.g., higher-order risk attitudes or prospect theory) are needed to explain insurance demand.
